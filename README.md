# Wine data analysis

Data taken from https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews

This short project analyses data made of wine descriptions provided by wine reviewers, points given, price and other properties like location and variety. 
The project consists of:
- analysis of numerical variables, concerned with exploring distribtuons and identifying any correlations
- applying nlp library `spacy` to extract each wine flavor profile and food pairings, if present
- interactive dashboard, where one can tune parameteres (like country, price etc) and see different descriptive plots as well as information about wine flavors and pairings
Dashborads examples:
